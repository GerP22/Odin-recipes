        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A grilled beef patty on a bun is called a burger. Lunch at a fast food restaurant often consists of a burger and fries. You can use the word burger as a casual shorthand for hamburger, which is ground or minced beef that's fried and served on a bun.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons dill pickle relish</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>2 pounds ground beef, 80/20</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
                <li>6 slices American cheese</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>How to make a Cheeseburger</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>BURGER SAUCE: In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, ketchup, dill pickle relish and Dijon; set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine beef, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Using a wooden spoon or clean hands, stir until well combined. Gently form into 6 1-inch-thick patties, about the size of the hamburger buns</li>
                <li>Heat canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add patties and cook until lightly charred or until desired doneness, about 3-5 minutes per side; top with cheese.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately in hamburger buns with BURGER SAUCE and desired toppings.</li>
